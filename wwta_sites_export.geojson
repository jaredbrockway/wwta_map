Stroll north along the spit and enjoy more of Puget Sound's birdlife.\n\n<strong>Ala Spit Background</strong>\nThe earliest survey data for the Ala Spit area is dated 1908.\n\nAla Spit eventually became an interest for real estate development. By the 1960s, in line with thinking at the time, Rip Rap revetments were installed in an effort to protect the private property interests.\n\nIn 1995, Island Co. passed a Conservation Futures Funds measure to purchase Ala Spit for a County Park. In 1997, a WWTA site was added.\n\nOver the years, the neck of Ala Spit became narrow and there was concern over losing access.\n\nStarting in the early 2000's, there was increasing focus in Puget Sound on the importance of estuary and near-shore areas, such as Ala Spit, to endangered Chinook salmon, and the forage fish on which they feed.\n\nFrom 2005, to the present, Ala Spit has been the focus of a number of feasibility studies, restoration efforts, and monitoring. Most of this work has been funded by grants from the Washington State Salmon Recovery Funding Board (SRFB), with cooperation between Island Co., Tribal Nations, and various state and federal agencies. The latest was Ala Spit Restoration, Phase 4, in 2016. This funded a partial removal of the bulkhead, and modification to the rock groin. Monitoring is on-going.\n\n<em>Oct. 23,2022\nCompiled for a WWTA Ala Spit work party\nBarbara Brock\nFounding Member, WWTA\nCo-Chair, Island Co.

It satisfies the goal of having a site every three hours in case one needs to take a break.\n\nThey have kindly asked us to use a reservation system for Oak Harbor as we do at Anderson and Vashon Islands. This will help them delineate our members from others who may want to walk-in and camp. Our campsites are only available to those who approach by water in human powered craft.\n\nPlease use the following system.&nbsp;\n\n[booking type=3]\n\nThank you Karen Borell for documenting <a href=\"/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Oak-Harbor-City-Park_Karen-Borell.pdf\">the history of this site</a>.
